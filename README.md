Program for football âš½

How to use the program:

You must first log in with ip other than this (with vpn) to be able to get information about countries.
In the MYSQL.py \ Pass file, enter your MYSQL username in line 3 and enter your MYSQL password in line 4 to save your information (due to time constraints, I could not choose not to save the information if the user wanted to. ).
By running Pass \ Main.py the program is run and you can use the program.
If you have not created an account, you must create an account, and after creating an account and logging in, you can use the program. After logging in, you will see a list of countries with the photo with their names. After you find the country you want, go to the bottom of the page and enter the name of the country to see the list of matches in that country and Similarly, until you see the names of the players who play in a team, then see the program and go through the steps again to select the new information you want (due to problems with the api in sending information can not be again Received the information correctly, the program must be closed and the steps must be repeated)
